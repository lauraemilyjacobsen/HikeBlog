	<p>
		I'm a software developer with the travel bug. Born and raised in Sitka, Alaska,
		I've lived in Boston, Aix-en-Provence, New York City, Paris, and London. 
		
	For the
		last few years, my home has been Seattle, where the best thing to do is get out
		of the city and go hiking.
	</p>
	<p>
		On a sunny weekend, you can find me in the mountains; when it rains, I'm at home
		reading guidebooks about places most people have never heard of.
	</p>
	<p>
		This blog is my place to record images and experiences from hiking and traveling.
		It's also my way of having fun with snazzy web development technologies that I don't
		always get to use at work.
	</p>
	<p>
		Wherever I go, I like it best when I'm with my husband <a target="_blank" href="http://www.about.me/paulbuxton">
			Paul Buxton</a>.
