	Paul was working all weekend, and I made the long drive to Mt. Baker for a 
	weekend of solo hiking. First up was the Chain Lakes loop, which weaves around 
	the jumble of volcanic slopes and alpine lakes around Artist Point. The NOAA 
	forecast kept promising clearer skies shortly, but the blanket of clouds never 
	lifted. At least the gray light threw the slopes of fall color into bright 
	contrast.</p>

	Up over Herman Saddle, I noticed a little tarn on a shelf above the trail 
	ahead. I found the boot path leading to the pond, which had an infinity pool 
	effect at its outlet. The background was completely obscured by clouds, giving 
	the reflecting pool a dreamlike quality.</p>

	The little pond was so gorgeous that on Sunday, which had bluebird skies, I came 
	back to photograph it in different light. The sunlight brought out the pinkish 
	tones in the rock and made the pond into a deep blue mirror. On the other hand, 
	I like the mystical quality of the lake backed by white clouds.</p>

	The nice thing about hiking solo is that I can do unpleasant things in order to 
	get a great photo, without dragging along whiny companions. 4:30 on Sunday 
	morning saw me hauling myself out of the tent at the Douglas Fir campground, 
	boiling up a quick coffee, and driving back up the road. I found a spot on one 
	of the platforms on Picture Lake and watched the mist rise off the lake in the 
	sunrise.</p>

	I continued up to the end of the road at Artist Point, got some shots of the 
	sunlight on Mt. Baker, and did the short trail up Table Mountain and back.</p>

	My other goal before doing the Lake Ann trail was to go back to the little tarn 
	below Herman Saddle that I had photographed in the clouds yesterday. There&#39;s a 
	network of criss-crossing trails in the basin below the highway and Table 
	Mountain, and I worked out that the shortest route would start at the Heather 
	Meadows parking lot. This parking lot and the tourist trails just below it are 
	almost obscenely beautiful.</p>

<p>
	I booked it along the Chain Lakes trail, retracing my steps until I found the 
	little tarn, as I said earlier.</p>

	By the time I got back to the car, it was past noon, I had already hiked 4-5 
	miles, without starting the main attraction of the day: Lake Ann. I had a 
	conference call scheduled with my company&#39;s India team for 9PM, and with a 
	three-hour drive home, I would have to move fast to do this 8.4 mile hike and 
	get home in time. The elevation profile of this trail is a U shape: it descends 
	steeply in the beginning, follows a flat, wooded valley floor, then climbs up to 
	a pass overlooking the lake, which is perched like an infinity pool on the side 
	of a cliff.</p>

	Mt. Shuksan looms over the left side of the lake, with fantastic views of the 
	Upper and Lower Curtis glaciers.</p>

<p>
	I circumnavigated the lake, completely awed by the panorama. The lower mountain 
	slopes glowed reddish with berry bushes, while the tip of Shuksan gleamed in the 
	clear sky. This is why I put up with the long winters, dreary cityscape, and 
	passive-agressive attitudes in Seattle, for the privilege in being in places 
	that just feel right. This panorama almost shows how beautiful it was.</p>
