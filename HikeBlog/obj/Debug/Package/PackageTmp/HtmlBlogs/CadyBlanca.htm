	Paul&#39;s friend David was up for going on a hike, which would be his first in 
	Washington before moving to Portland. I had read some glowing trip reports about 
	the West Cady Ridge trail to Benchmark Mountain in the Skykomish area off US-2. 
	The plan was to backpack, but with thunderstorms in the forecast, we decided to 
	go part of the way along the ridge as a day trip on Saturday, camp, at the 
	trailhead, and do the nearby Blanca Lake trail on Sunday.</p>
<p>
	David navigated through the twists and turns on the dry, dusty Forest Service 
	roads to the West Cady Ridge trailhead. The dry spell in Washington was dragging 
	on, and we started up the trail in the heat, breaking out above treeline to the 
	ridge. It was... okay. The famed fields of lupine were tired and dusty, like 
	Depression-era housewives in faded aprons. The views to the surrounding peaks 
	were nice but less than spectacular by Washington standards. David flicked a wet 
	washcloth around his face and neck to swat the swarming flies. I was introducing 
	a newbie hiker to the outdoors, and I had brought him on what was probably the 
	least interesting hike of the season.</p>

	The one noteworthy thing about this trail was the variety of mushrooms and 
	fungus along it.

	The hike up to Blanca Lake is fairly nondescript, except for its steepness. At 
	least it wasn&#39;t quite as hot as yesterday, but as we trundled up the seemingly 
	endless series of switchbacks, with no views except for dry trees, I felt a 
	little bad for dragging David along. I hoped the lake would be worthwhile. It is 
	beautiful, the turquoise color caused by glacial silt. The lake is nested below 
	the Columbia massif, just a few valleys away from one of our favorite places, 
	Gothic Basin.</p>

	The thing with really popular lake hikes is that there&#39;s not a lot to do when 
	you get there. Exploring the perimeter would have required navigating a logjam 
	ad the outlet, and I wasn&#39;t going to attempt anything fancy since David had made 
	it up here barely alive. We had a snack and took pictures. David took a cute 
	picture of me and Paul.</p>

	He kept clicking the shutter as Paul went in for a sweet kiss... then lifted his 
	rear end for a fart.</p>

	Two clownish men, one in swimming trunks and one in underpants that accented his
	hairy, bulging belly, approached us with a video camera. Would David mind filming
	them as they jumped into the lake? "But don't show my friend's package!" admonished the one who was slighly more modestly clothed. 
	That would have been easier said than done.It was pure entertainment as the buddies navigated
	the outlet logjam to the edge and prepared to leap in. The first one went solo with
	a headfirst dive.</p>

<p>Next, the pair did a not-quite-synchronized backwards leap.</p>

	In higher spirits, we headed down the trail. At the bottom, David pronounced me 
	and Paul insane for doing this every weekend. The traffic delay on US-2 near 
	Gold Bar was terrible; we spent an hour inching along the road. Later, there was 
	road construction with a confusing detour. Next time I bring a new hiker along, 
	I&#39;m choosing a hike that&#39;s guaranteed to be spectacular enough to inspire a love 
	of the outdoors. Sadly, I think I did the opposite this time.</p>
