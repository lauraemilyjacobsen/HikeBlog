<!-- 1. Onion Valley, Kearsarge to Charlotte Lake -->
<p>
	Day 0: Reno to Independence to Onion Valley
</p>
<p>
	On Saturday, Paul and I flew into Reno and drove down the 395 to the little town of Independence. The High Sierra is known for some of the most
	reliable dry, sunny weather that hikers could hope for. Today, though,  rain started to spatter the car as we drove past Mono Lake and black thunderclouds
	bulked above the mountains. I thought of the month of warm weather and clear skies that we had left behind in the normally soggy Washington Cascades. I wondered
	how my dad was faring in that rainstorm ahead of us and if this would be a survival trip.
</p>
<p>
	We pulled into the parking lot of the Mt. Williamson Motel just minutes after Kelsey and Eric, who had driven up from Santa Barbara. We sorted gear and
	Kelsey handed out the WAG bags distributed by the ranger when they picked up our permits from the station in Lone Pine. After a night of sleep on the world's 
	flimsiest pillows, we had breakfast at the motel and met Ken and Wendy, a retired couple who were doing the entire JMT and taking a rest day in town. We drove up to the Onion Valley campground at about 9000 feet, where the skies looked ominous. We set up our tents at the reserved spot and 
	chatted with the laid-back campground host, Mike. That afternoon we went up a trail to a small lake at about 10,000 feet to get some acclimitization to the
	altitude. Sun breaks interspersed with showers all afternoon. That evening, we worked very hard to keep a tiny fire ablaze and got to sleep early.

</p>
<p>
	Today was our first day of proper hiking, getting off to a strong start with 8 miles topping out at Kearsarge Pass at 11,760 feet. It was mostly sunny today, and we passed many 
	lakes glittering deep blue in contrast to the sandy peaks. A little beyond Kearsarge Pass, we crossed paths with a friendly woman who introduced herself
	as Cindy. She had walked with my dad for a few days but was bailing on the trail due to a dodgy hip. My dad was at the Sandy Junction at Charlotte Lake as planned, and he told us about
	pitching his tent in a shallow depression that became a mud puddle in the rainstorm. We had our first freeze-dried dinner, and I was pleasantly surprised
	by Mountain House vegetarian lasagna. I brought a secret ingredient to add to the freeze-dried mix (a baggie of garlic powder) that everyone seemed to appreciate.

<!-- 2. Charlotte Lake to King's-Kern Divide -->
<p>
	Day 2: Bubb's Creek to a campsite near the King's-Kern Divide, 9/11/12
</p>
<p>
	The day started with a drop into the Bubb's Creek valley. Availability of water was a concern today, as it would be from here out.
	Due to light snowfall the past winter, many water sources were running dry. We found a campsite on a rise well above the river valley,
	where my dad remembered a trickling stream on the slope across the trail. The views ahead were of the King's-Kern Divide towards Forester
	Pass, which we would cross the next day. The clouds and sun interspersed to make fantastic patterns on the mountains ahead and behind. As I moseyed around 
	taking pictures, several parties of hikers passed by with the same question: Is there water anywhere around here? I'm a permanently thirsty person
	so I made plenty of trips to the spring and made sure the Platypuses were full.

<!-- 3. Forester Pass, Bighorn Plateau -->
<p>
	Day 3: Over Forester Pass, across the Bighorn Plateau, to Wright's Creek, 9/12/12
</p>
<p>
Another big day, covering 12 miles and crossing 13,153-foot Forester Pass under blazing sun. 
	We started walking before dawn and approached the switchbacks by
	mid-morning. The land here is stark and jagged, a contrast to the rounded edges 
	of Washington.</p>

</p>
<p>
	We descended the pass, the backside of which was a little vertiginous but not as scary as my dad made it sound. We had lunch among glorious
	reflecting lakes from where we could barely see the path the way we came. Golden marmots approached us to beg, adorable but unfortunately
	accustomed to humans.

</p>
<p>
	The rest of the day was long, dusty, dry, and hot, in the midst of stark moonscapes.
	Water sources were scarce and shade scarcer. As breathtakingly beautiful as the scenery was, it was a relief to find a wooded camping spot
	near Wright's Creek, where we bathed our feet in the stream.</p>

<!-- 4. To Guitar Lake -->
<p>
	Day 4: Guitar Lake and beyond, 9/13/12</p>
<p>
	Most hikers camp at Guitar Lake the night before climbing Mt. Whitney. My dad 
	knew of a little lake just beyond Guitar Lake, where we would be a little more secluded and get a small head start in the morning. The landscape 
	got even wilder today, with mountain pinnacles jabbing at the sky in a barren 
	bowl. 
</p>

</p>
<p>
Our camping spot was right at the foot of Mt. Whitney. We enjoyed the sunset while we ate our final freeze-dried meal and Paul regaled us with
stories of high-altitude diarrhea in Ladakh in the Indian Himalayas. This was the only night where I wished I had packed another layer of clothes, especially
when I dropped my hat into the cooking water and it took forever to dry.

<!-- 5. Summit -->
<p>
	Day 5: Whitney Summit, descent to Whitney Portal, 9/14/12</p>
<p>
	Summit day! The bad weather of the previous week was a distant memory as the stars were out in clear skies when we woke up. We were on the trail at 3:45, 
	hiking by headlamp. My trail name on the 2010 trip was Morning Buzz due to my need for caffeine, and I fueled up with a big handful of chocolate coated
	espresso beans. Up and up and up we went, and I was pleased with myself because it wasn't too hard. We went slowly, but at high altitude every step takes
	a lot more out of you. I felt okay all the way up--it seems that our busy summer of backpacking paid off. At Trail Crest, the junction where the John Muir
	Trail meets the trail from Whitney Portal and joins up with the summit trail, we dropped our packs with non-essential gear for the last 800 feet of elevation gain.
	 As the sun rose, we approached the 
	ragged crest, where V-shaped windows open up to the east.
</p>

</p>
<p>
Mt. Whitney doesn't look like it should be the highest point in the Lower 48. Near the summit, the mountain flattens out to a scree and boulder field.
There was a loudmouth moron blabbing to everyone who would listen, which made me wonder if every summit has to have a resident jerk. Finally he left,
and shortly afterwards Ken and Wendy (the couple from the Mt. Williamson Motel) arrived.

</p>
<p>
	On the way down to Trail Crest, we could see all the way back the way we had come. This was followed by descending the east side of the pass on the infamous
	99 Switchbacks, a steep, rocky trail where very soon the summit loomed high above us.
</p>

</p>
<p>
	Finally it was time for coffee and a rest in the gorgeous area below the switchbacks, among little ponds like the bathtubs of the gods.

</p>
<p>We still had many miles to cover and many thousands of feet to descend. Down over boulder fields, scree slopes, past overnighters, and finally down 
a long series of switchbacks where the road's end at Whitney Portal was tantalizingly in view. After covering 15 miles and being at the highest point
in the lower 48, we walked dazed and dehydrated into the portal. My uncle Bob, who had kindly come up from Los Angeles to pick us up, was a welcome sight.
We had a celebratory beer, and then Bob shuttled us down to Lone Pine in two trips... with a clean towel for each of us to sit on.</p>
