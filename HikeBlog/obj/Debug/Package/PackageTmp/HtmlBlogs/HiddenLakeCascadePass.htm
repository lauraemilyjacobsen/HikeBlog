<p>
	A big weekend of hiking along the Cascade River Road, which veers into some of 
	the most dramatic, yet accessible, alpine terrain in the state. On Saturday we 
	hiked up to the Hidden Lake Lookout. The lookout is a little hut perched in a 
	spectacular setting ringed by the North Cascades. Unfortunately, we shared the 
	area with a group of braying idiots who got in the way of my photography and 
	polluted the air with their loud voices. Certain places are like outdoor temples 
	and merit respectfully soft voices.</p>

	Too late to get an overnight permit to camp at the lakeshore, which is inside 
	the North Cascades National Park boundary, we picked a site off the trail 
	further down, safely in National Forest territory with no permit required.

	Sunset was phenomenal, with this peak, which I think is Mt. Buckindy, lit up in 
	pink and gold, and Mt. Baker in silhouette right in front of the tent. The 
	evening was calm and quiet... until the moment we zipped up the tent. At that 
	instant, a sudden, howling, wind picked up, and shrieked all night. The tent 
	rattled, with sounds like being stuffed in the gap between two high-speed 
	trains. Morning was no better. Cooking breakfast at the campsite was out of the 
	question--it was all we could do to pack up the tent without it blowing off the 
	side of the cliff. We descended to a more sheltered place down the trail for 
	breakfast.</p>

	The wildflower displays on the middle section of the Hidden Lakes trail are some 
	of the better ones I&#39;ve seen. I particularly like the tall plants with green 
	flowers--I&#39;m not sure what they&#39;re called, but green flowers are unique and 
	beautiful.</p>

	Because just one trail isn&#39;t enough for one weekend, we drove all the way to the 
	end of the Cascade River Road to hike to Cascade Pass and Sahale Arm. This was a 
	favorite from last summer and I wanted to do it again and get better photos this 
	time around. The trail to Cascade Pass was as I remembered: a series of 30+ 
	pointless switchbacks, taking about 3.5 miles to cover a couple thousand 
	vertical feet no more than a quarter mile from the parking lot. Once beyond the 
	pass and on the trail to Sahale Arm, the view was as beautiful as I remembered. 
	We even saw a mother and baby grouse or ptarmigan in the undergrowth.</p>

	It&#39;s hard to walk fast up Sahale Arm because the views are so incredible. Even 
	with the smoke from the forest fires, the purplish Stehekin River valley 
	beckoned to the east. Stehekin is one of the places we keep talking about but 
	haven&#39;t been yet... maybe next year.

	As we walked up, a high layer of thin cloud streamed in, throwing the reddish 
	ground cover into relief. It was only late August, but there were hints of gold 
	and red fall color to come, accentuated by the yellows of thirsty plants.</p>

	The layer of cloud settled in, casting an eerie gloom around us. It was quiet on 
	the arm, with almost no other hikers. The last time we hiked this trail it had 
	been a zoo on a clear day, with large groups shouting exuberantly. Today it was 
	peaceful, if melancholy in the hushed atmosphere.</p>

	We did encounter one hiker coming up as we were on the way down. He pointed at 
	the slope above us, right where we had just come from, and said, &quot;You just 
	walked past a bear.&quot; Sure enough, there was a huge black bear grazing not far 
	below the trail that we had just come down.</p>

	And a pudgy marmot waddled up to us just below a talus slope on the way back. 
	Another marmot ran onto the trail, paused, and let out an ear-splitting whistle. 
	I had heard&nbsp; plenty of marmots whistle, but not that close, and it was 
	loud! It pierced the silent, gray late afternoon and reminded us that it was 
	still a long way home. We raced down the switchbacks, cursing the Park Service 
	for making the trail so friendly to out-of-shape tourists, and I somehow stayed 
	awake to drive home.</p>
