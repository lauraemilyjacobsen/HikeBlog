	The turn of the year brought the first good weather and stable snow conditions on
	a weekend this winter. On 12/30/12, we invested 6 hours of driving to go to Artist
	Point for a snowshoe. It was three months to the day since I was up there in full
	autumn colors. Nature's changes are dramatic. The hillsides that were red, orange,
	and purple with fall foliage in September were smooth walls of white traced with
	ski tracks. The reflecting ponds near the ranger station were covered in several
	feet of ice and snow. The snow was recent enough to be smooth and undisturbed, making
	eerie shapes out of trees.

	The snowshoe from the Heather Meadows ski area parking lot to Artist point roughly
	follows the road, hidden under many feet of snow. It's a short distance, but easily
	the most beautiful and easily accessible scenery for snowshoeing in the state.</p>

	Mt. Shuksan reigned over the scene. I enjoyed looking down the valley from Artist
	Point to find the route of the trail from the Artist Point road to Lake Ann that
	I took in September.

	New Year's Day had a good weather forecast, so we went for our second-favorite snowshoe
	destination, Hurricane Ridge in the Olympics. Although the day started out clear,
	a high layer of white cloud drifted over the peninsula by the time we got on the
	trail. Not many people were on the trail (probably nursing hangovers), so there
	was a hush over the mountains enhanced by the still whiteness. We snowshoed up to
	Hurricane Hill, also a place we had visited in the summer.

	Hurricane Ridge runs roughly north-south on the northern edge of the Olympic range.
	You get a vantage point gazing into the heart of the Olympics, one of the wildest
	parts of the state. Today, the early afternoon sky turned pastel pink and orange,
	while wisps of cloud snaked through the river valleys.
