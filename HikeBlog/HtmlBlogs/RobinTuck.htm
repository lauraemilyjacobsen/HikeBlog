	My birthday was on a Wednesday and there was no way I was going to spend it in a
	cubicle in downtown Seattle with pigeons and crackheads outside. I had something
	more like this in mind.</p>

	Getting an alpine start for a hike on a Monday morning is not easy. I wanted to
	get a good night's sleep so didn't set an early alarm. Then I had some last-minute
	work emails to deal with... then I had to pick up the truck. Several hours later,
	after bouncing through the craters of the moon and fording a creek on the Cle Elum
	River Road, recalling some unpleasant roads in Nepal and Tibet, we arrived at the
	trailhead at a leisurely 2:00. A lunch picnic, organizing the gear, and on the trail
	by 3.</p>
<!--snip-->
<p>
	We walked the first, easiest section of the trail to the junction with the "unofficial"
	trail to Robin and Tuck. Camp was at a pleasant forested spot just past the junction.
	The next morning, we made quick time uphill to Tuck Lake, a pretty little lake in
	a granite bowl.

<p>
	From here, the "trail" is a steep, rocky boot path marked with cairns. It felt a lot
	longer than its 1.4 miles.

	Robin Lakes sit in a basin of smooth, lumpy granite. It's supposed to be a zoo on
	weekends, but there was only one other party of two middle-aged men when we arrived.

	Paul enjoyed bathing his feet in the freezing outlet from Upper to Lower Robin Lake near our campsite.

	A family of goats milled around the area between our campsite and the two guys. There
	were at least 14 individuals. One goat was particularly curious and kept coming back
	to our campsite despite trying to scare him off with rocks.

	Paul peed on a rock on the way up the ridge to watch the sunrise. Goats love pee because of its salt, and hikers are
	encouraged to urinate on rocks rather than in vegetation since goats will dig up fragile meadow 
	flowers to get at the urine. These goats blocked our
	exit by licking his urine off the rock right in the place where we wanted to get through.

	I appreciated the views of Mt. Daniel more on the way down to Tuck Lake. This trail was also
	a little scarier than the way up. The airy ledges are much more 
	noticable when you're facing downhill. I don't know if trekking poles were more useful
	or annoying. Some of the descent is best done scooting down crab-style with your hands.

	This little lake is called Tuck's Pot. We stopped here for lunch and agreed that with the
	turquoise water and vivid green trees, it could almost be a jungle pool in Central America.
