	Another sunny weekend. Paul was helping out at a weird niche music festival. Who needs a husband to hike with?
	This trip report on nwhikers.net said there was a bear in Berkeley Park near Sunrise. Sweet! There are lots of
	bears in Sitka where I'm from, but I had never seen a bear in Washington. Plus, there should be pretty flowers.

	The hordes of tourists on the trail thinned out at the Frozen Lake Junction. A little further, there was a family of
	marmots on a small talus slope. One was digging up food next to the trail, another one was running back and forth with
	mouthfuls of grass to dry for the winter.

	Dropping into the park, the flowers were beautiful but not quite peaking. Maybe a week later. The cloudless sky and fierce sun
	made for challenging photography in the middle of the day. This would be a good place for flower photography on an
	overcast August day.

	No sign of a bear. One lady was jingling her car keys. I didn't tell her my dad's corny joke that bears think bells are 
	dinner bells. The other hiker said some backpackers at Berkeley camp had seen the bear
	earlier this morning. It was probably too hot for the bear to be out and about. Some other hikers having a picnic off
	the trail (bad meadow stompers!) said the ranger had mentioned a bear. I walked as far as Berkeley camp. It was hot
	and humid and absolutely still. I decided to give up on the bear idea and run up Burroughs Mountain.
	I should still be able to meet my target time of 4:00 back in the car.
</p>
<p>
	A few minutes later I noticed a stump in the meadow about 50 feet to the right of the trail. The stump had ears
	and a round white nose and was looking at me. It was the bear! A dark cinnamon bear. An older couple came up behind me and we watched
	the bear watching us. Then its cub came out of the woods. A small group of hikers backed up on the trail as the bear and cub
	wandered around the meadow, never coming closer to us, and eventually slipped into the trees.

	I still had time for Burroughs. This is a dry shoulder of Mt Rainier leading up to a glacier. Of the three peaks of
	Burroughs, I only had time to get to the first, which still had awesome views of the glaciers and snow fields.
