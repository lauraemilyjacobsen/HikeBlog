	Just 3 days after my birthday backpack to Robin Lakes, it was the weekend and time
	for another trip. Last year we hiked the Maple Pass loop in the North Cascades and
	liked the look of the Cutthroat Pass area across the highway. The plan was to camp
	at Cutthroat Pass and hike a little further towards Canada along the Pacific Crest
	Trail.
</p>
<p>
	The trail climbs gently through dry forest until just below the pass, where the
	views open up the valley to the south. Things get spectacular at the pass.

	We continued a couple of miles further along the dry trail, over a scree field below
	sheer cliffs, to a point close to Granite Pass. We chatted with a Pacific Crest
	Trail through-hiker who started in California in April. He said the Washington section
	was the best yet and that we were lucky to be able to hike here whenever we want.

	Paul found a boot path uphill to a point overlooking the Golden Horn and Tower Mountain.
	The Golden Horn is a batholith, a sheer-faced mountain composed of sparkling minerals.

	Much of the rock on this trail has the runny cake batter look similar to the rock
	formations in Utah. In fact, there was a little arch at one point.

	Back at Cutthroat Pass, we hiked up the knoll to the south as advised by Harvey
	Manning in the 100 Hikes book for a late afternoon panorama. The people camping
	up there had the best site.

	Shortly after zipping up the tent, <i>crunch... crunch</i>. Soft footsteps passed
	to the side of our tent. Paul unzipped and looked out. Nothing. We went back inside.
	Pat.. pat. More footsteps. Paul got out again and walked around the tent. Nothing.
	Invisible goats? Stealthy hikers who got a late start? Sasquatch? It was a little
	creepy but the footsteps didn't come back.
</p>
<p>
	In the morning we went up to the pass for sunrise.

	The morning light livened up the colors in the campsite basin, which in the afternoon
	had looked dry and stark.

	The 4.5 mile hike uphill yesterday had been a breeze--we had gotten ourselves conditioned
	to carrying overnight packs. The hike back to the parking lot wouldn't take more
	than a couple of hours, so we decided to revisit Maple Pass, the trailhead just
	across the highway. This trail is interesting because you can see the transition
	from the wet greens and blues of the west Cascades to the dry, rugged browns and
	purples of the east.
	Those peaks in the background behind the lake are where we were last night.</p>

	I spent a long time taking pictures. This is really the most beautiful spot in the
	Cascades.

	The distant skies were a little hazy but I used my birthday present from Paul to
	get zoom shots of Dome Peak to the southwest and the Early Winters Spires to the
	east.

	One last look back at the fairy tale valley before the knee-jarring descent and
