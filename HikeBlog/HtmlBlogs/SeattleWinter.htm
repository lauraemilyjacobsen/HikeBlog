	It started to rain in the middle of October and has barely stopped. Winter in Seattle
	sucks as much as the summers in Washington are glorious. Snow starts to cover the
	best trails, and the weather is so bad that you wouldn't want to go hiking most of the time
	anyway.</p>
	
	<p>Seattle is not a beautiful city in the best of weather, and in winter it's drab and depressing. As my bus to work trundles past the fascist concrete skyscrapers
	and crummy condos downtown, I imagine how I would improve the city if I were in charge. Make it
	a visually stimulating place: colorful plants that bloom at different times of the year, brightly
	painted murals, pedestrian-only streets, adding architectural accents. The only public art near my workplace
	is the Chihuly glass sculpture in Benaroya Hall that looks like the <a target="_blank" href="http://moreseattlestuff.blogspot.com/2009/02/more-floor-to-ceiling-at-benaroya-hall.html">sperm of Cthulu</a>.

	I did a couple of photography outings looking for bright spots in Seattle. The Japanese
	garden in the Washington Park Arboretum in one of the rare places in Seattle designed
	for beauty. The last of the fall colors were striking on the November day that I
	visited.

	Pike Place Market is probably the most touristy location in Seattle. Despite that,
	it's fun. I work nearby and often walk over in the summer to buy local raspberries
	and nectarines. On a dark, wet December afternoon, I played around with capturing
	bright city lights.

	It was good fun, but nothing like the exertion of a long trail rewarded with a magnificent mountain vista. How long until the snow melts?
