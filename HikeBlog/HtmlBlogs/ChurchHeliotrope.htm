	Two hikes, one night above the clouds, and a contemplative marmot at Mt. Baker. A pretty perfect weekend.

	Church Mountain was still socked in when we got to the first basin. Glacier lilies were bursting from the edge of the snow. One couple decided to turn back here rather than c
	cross the 100' of snow to the slope where the continuation of the trail was clearly visible.

<p>
	We found a campsite tucked away on a knoll a little further up. The previous campers had left behind some eggshells and garbage in the fire pit. Pack
	out your trash, people! We set up camp and hung out until it looked like the clouds might be lifting. The fog burned away as we ascended the ridge, and Mt.
	Baker was in full view by the time we got to the end of the trail at the false summit.

	Sunset was spectacular with clouds streaming through the Nooksack Valley, brilliant gold light on the lupine meadows, and alpenglow on Baker and Shuksan.

	The next morning was just as beautiful from the summit. The clouds never left the valley below, but the views reached all the way into the North Cascades Impenetrable Area.

	A marmot was perched on a high rock, enjoying the view. If I could choose to be an animal, I would
	be a marmot. They live in my favorite habitat: high glacial basins with wildflowers, surrounded by peaks.

	On the way down I took a <a href="http://photosynth.net/view.aspx?cid=4b91e974-b857-4b39-9c96-9e29bdea736b&m=false&i=0:0:0&c=0:0:0&z=474.117093712948&d=-1.08235654434643:-1.08235654434643:-1.28519984790526&p=0:0&t=False" target="_blank">pano of the lower basin</a>.
</p>
<p>
	Our next stop was the Heliotrope Ridge trail, on the south side of the Mt. Baker Highway. The path led through pretty but unspectacular forest, with a few
	interesting stream crossings, to the viewpoint of the glacier tumbling down in a jumble of seracs.

	It was still early evening when we got back to the car, so we drove up to Artist Point, which had just been cleared of snow for the summer <a href="http://photosynth.net/view.aspx?cid=8c1cbcb2-1404-46cb-b509-1d946a354747&m=false&i=0:0:0&c=0:0:0&z=474.117093712948&d=-1.33309596360775:0.860774972905294:0.909558347221428&p=0:0&t=False" target="_blank">(panorama)</a>. We snowshoed here
	back in February and it was fun to identify the place where we ate lunch, which was on top of 20+ feet of snow on the parking lot. I also got the classic Mt.
	Shuksan shot from Picture Lake just down the road. An autumn trip back here is in order.
